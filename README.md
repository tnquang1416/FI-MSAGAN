# FI-MSAGAN
My personal implementation for Multi-Scale Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Video Frame Interpolation (2020).

# Requirements
This is a PyTorch implementation. Hence, we need PyTorch>=1.5.0 for it.

The previous version of PyTorch may work but we have not checked.

# Dataset
The target dataset of this implementation is the Vimeo-90k dataset. Please see the Vimeo-90k dataset documentation for further information.
